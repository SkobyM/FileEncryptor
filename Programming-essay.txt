I love programming, I write programs in many languages such as C++, Java, Python, PHP, c# and Assembly.
To be a professional programmer, you should think in programs with your own brain and write them by your own hands. Without that you will not be a good programmer.
Remember that you did the same when you started learning how to eat, how to walk and how to write!
Good luck.
